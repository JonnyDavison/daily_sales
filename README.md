## Project Overview
Developing 'Daily Sales' has been a been a long time coming from the authors previous career. This daily analysis is essential to the succeful running of small and medium food buisness, where this information is key to decission making ahead of the following day. The development process included, reserach, indusrty knowlege and followed a logic flowchart. There are built in features to assit and guide the user throught the program:

- Error handeling to validate user input
- User feedback on the input (Custom ValueError messages)
- Text spacing for user readability 
- Useful information passed back quickly to the user
- Information stored in order to provide accounts for review

The project also uses Google Worksheet API for:
- Inputing and storing Data 
- Sales, Costs & Results pages to store financial data
- Pulling data for calulation
- Storing the calulation results
- Providing the user with a large data set
This is the [Google worksheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NckZYPLVFrlbqXG2FIFwfhZlNg0fQ67WtQURLmhWKC8/edit?usp=sharing) used to hold the data

## Project Goals
- Develop CLI based Sales analysis application using Python
- Request and present information in a clear and easy to understand manner
- Keep good UX principles regarding layout and interaction
- Robust Python code without issues/bugs

## User Experience
### User Expectations
- Able to quickly understand what the app is for
- Provide additional information directing the user 
- Iteractions have feedback
- Provide format instructions to assit in gathering the correct data
- No logic errors

### User Stories
- I want to know what is this site for
- I want to know what information to provide
- I want to store my information
- I want to get feedback on my interactions
- I want to get relavant information returned to me
- I want no bugs or issues in the program

## Design

### Structure
(images/flowchart.webp)

Flowchart was designed at the start of the project. The final result differs from the flowchart slightly on account of implementing changes for better UX.

GitPod - Used to commit, comment and push code during the development process.
grammerly spell 
LanguageTool - Used to spell-check the contents of README.md
pyfiglet
Heroku - used to deploy the project

Deployment
The project was written and hosted on GitHub. The author used GitHub's terminal output with command 'python3 run.py' to run the program logic. After the project was developed enough, it was deployed on Heroku using the following method:

Add dependencies in GitPod to requirements.txt file with command "pip3 freeze > requirements.txt"
Commit and push to GitHub
Go to the Heroku Dashboard
Click "Create new app"
Name app and select location
Add Config Vars for Creds and Port in Settings tab
Add the buildbacks to Python and NodeJS in that order
Select appropriate deployment method, GitHub
Connect to Github and link to repository
Enable automatic deployment and/or deploy manually
Click on Deploy

Credits
Code used and adapted
The author used his previous projects, 

Code Institute template was used to start the project.
Using Google worksheet was seen during Code Institute Love Sandwiches project, ( GithHub repository here ).


Websites visited to gather knowledge
There were many sites visited during the duration of the project. Google was used to produce results of the specific query, and Stack Overflow proved to be the best source of information for various queries/issues.

The standout webpages are:

This website was used to learn about sorting a string.
This website was used to learn about tabulating the leaderboard.
This website was used to learn about sleep.
This website was used to learn about typing print, input and clear screen.
This website was used to learn about restarting the program.
This website was used to learn about printing on a same line
